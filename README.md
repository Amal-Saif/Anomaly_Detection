**Overview:**

This project aims to detect Electrons (Anomaly) by training the model only on the Photons using Contrastive Learning.

**Dataset:**

For the top quark dataset:

**Requirements:** 

Strong knowledge of Python; Keras.

No need for a strong math background.

**Note:**

The code is still under verification.

**This project was mentored by [Prof. Sergei V. Gleyzer](http://sergeigleyzer.com/) and Ali Hariri.**
